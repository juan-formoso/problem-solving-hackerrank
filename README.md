# Hackerrank Problem Solving Test

# Introduction
This repository contains my answers to Hackerrank's problem solving test: 3 months Interview Preparation Kit.

I'm doing all this not only to evolve my skills but to prove myself (to myself) that I'm capable of doing this. And also to get prepared for jobs interviews.

## Progress
I'm currently at 26/104 and 3/13 in Tests as you can see in the print below:

## What can you do here?
At the paste 'challenges' you can find the code I used for each question. Feel free to use it, copy, study or whatever you want to do! =)

## More
- I'm using ONLY *Javascript* and *Python* for these challenges (Since they're my main languages at the moment).

- Didn't understand something I did? DM me on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Juaan_vf)!
