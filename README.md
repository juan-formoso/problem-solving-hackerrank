# Hackerrank Problem Solving Test

# Introduction
December 21, 2021.
The day I decided to face my biggest 'villain' in programming: problem solving and programming logic. I started with Hackerrank's problem solving test promoted by a 3 months Interview Preparation Kit.

I'm doing all this not only to evolve my skills but to prove myself (to myself) that I'm capable of doing this. And also to get prepared for a job interview that I'm gonna have soon.

## Progress
I'm solving a challenge per day. Currently I'm at 25/104 and 3/13 in Tests as you can see in the print below:

## What can you do here?
At the paste 'challenges' you can find the code I used for each question. Feel free to use it, copy, study or whatever you want to do! =)

## More
- I'm using ONLY *Javascript* and *Python* for these challenges (Since they're my main languages at the moment).

- Didn't understand something I did? DM me on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Juaan_vf)!
